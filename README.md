## Description

- Uses Axios, Props, UseEffect, UseState, Fragments
- Very clean and easy UX/UI
- The Wikipedia API is used
- Open to CORS, used dangerously close HTML
- Dispite the fact that Wikipedia is a trusted website, it can still make searching Wikipedia a cyber security problem
- Clean up UseEffect function is used for the popstate event
- Does not use React Router, yet
- This also uses a timeout to stop multiple searches very quickly.

## How To Use

- For the Accordion, you can click to open and close an accordion. This uses event listeners to see where you cliked and which one should be opened or closed. 
- For the Search, type in a term into the Search Bar to send a request to Wikipedia which fetches the term and snippet. 
- Hit Go to navigate to that term's page.
